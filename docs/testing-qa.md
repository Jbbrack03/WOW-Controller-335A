# Testing & QA

## Testing Matrix
- Windows 11 (ROG Ally)
- Windows 10 (Xbox controller)
- Linux (if supported by AzerothCore)

## Test Scenarios
- Game launch and main menu navigation
- Controller hot-plugging/disconnect
- In-game movement, camera, combat
- UI navigation (menus, settings, character select)
- Fallback to keyboard/mouse
- Edge cases (multiple controllers, sleep/resume)

## QA Best Practices (2025)
- Log all input events and errors
- Provide in-game feedback for failed mappings
- Regression test after AzerothCore or Windows updates
- Maintain a list of known issues and workarounds

## Reporting
- Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking
- Include hardware, OS, and steps to reproduce
