# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## Risks
- Patch conflicts with other client mods
- Anti-cheat false positives (if used outside self-hosted)
- Controller disconnects or input lag
- UI/UX bugs or inaccessible menus
- Windows/driver updates breaking compatibility
- Lack of community support for rare hardware

## Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain a clean client backup
- Test after each patch and document changes
- Log input and error events for debugging
- Provide fallback to keyboard/mouse
- Regularly update documentation and compatibility notes
- Encourage community feedback and contributions
